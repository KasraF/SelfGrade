# selfgrade
An organization (Web) App for balancing work and school without constantly forgetting to submit your EE16B selfgrade.

######NOTE: This is my first attempt at writing a program in GoLang. It is not meant for actual use. :( 

## TODO
- Missing core features:
  - Logout
  - Updating SQL tables
  - Basic account settings
  - HTML template parsing (separate library?)
  - Registring Apps

- Lingering questions:
  - What should be the color scheme?
  - Should we rename App to Module?
